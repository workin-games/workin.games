# Job Posting Standards

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a set of standards for job postings on our job board. These standards are intended to help employers and job seekers alike by providing a consistent and clear set of expectations for job postings.

## Standards

### Job Postings Must Be Legitimate

We expect job postings to be legitimate job opportunities. Job postings should not be used for the purpose of selling a product or service, recruiting for a multi-level marketing scheme, or any other purpose that is not related to a legitimate job opportunity.

### Job Postings Must Be Accurate and Complete

Job postings should accurately and completely describe the job opportunity. This includes providing a clear job title, a detailed job description, a list of requirements, and a salary or wage range.

### Job Postings Must Be Up to Date

Job postings should be regularly updated to ensure that the information is accurate and up to date. Outdated job postings should be removed from the job board.

### Job Postings Must Comply with Applicable Laws

Job postings should comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those related to discrimination and wage and hour laws.

### Job Postings Must Not Contain Inappropriate Content

Job postings should not contain any content that is considered inappropriate, such as offensive language, explicit images, or any other content that is not appropriate for a professional environment.
