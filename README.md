## The Process

All job postings are reviewed by our team before being published. We do this to ensure that all jobs are legitimate and that they meet our [standards](handbook/job-posting-standards.md). This process starts and ends as a pull request in this repository, so you can follow along with the process and see how we make decisions and voice any concerns you may have.

Once a job posting is approved, it will be published on our site and shared on our social media channels. We also send out a weekly newsletter to our subscribers, which includes all new job postings.
